>>> [Text] The Kevin Jenkins Experience, Chapter 1, Part I <<<
I realize this is technically a repost from three weeks ago, but 4chan screenshots aren't exactly easy-to-read, especially on mobile. So, I figured I'd locate an archive and repost the story here, in text form, for posterity.

For those that are unaware, this awesome HFY was written by /u/Hambone3110 a couple years ago, and inspired /u/guidosbestfriend 's HFY-in-progress [Humans Don't Make Good Pets](http://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/2flz4o/), set in the same universe.

“Next!” I ordered. I did not at first bother to look up from the desktop in front of me where the standard security systems were scanning the being in front of me for weapons, pathogens, parasites and other such contraband. I only looked up when the machine flashed a message I had never seen before: “ERROR: Unknown Species”

It was small. Barely tall enough to see over the top of my customs desk, in fact. A quadriform biped, forelimbs ending in five manipulating digits. Much of its body was covered in obviously synthetic fabric, with only the forepaws and head visible. Much of the head – the top, around the ears, and down under and around the mouth and nose – was covered in short, coarse fur of a brownish hue, apart from where this had been shaved in front of the ear to accept a cybernetic of some description. My desk registered this as the creature's Interspecies Communication Implant, though it seemed like a shockingly crude example.

It met my surprised stare with the level binocular gaze of a species evolved for predation and the hunt. Small, but powerful and dense-seeming. Despite its lack of height, it had strapped a pack to its torso that looked larger and heavier than I could have comfortably carried.

“Abductee 907-42-96-53-3.” It introduced itself. “Name - Kevin Jenkins.” Fortunately, the crude cybernetic seemed to be functioning perfectly, and I had no difficulty in understanding the thing's speech, or the subtle body language that spoke of a cocktail of bored resignation and weariness.

I had never had to deal with an abductee before, though I had been trained and knew exactly what to do. I closed the booth, stood up and gestured for the alien to follow me with my second right forelimb. “I will need to interview you in private.” I told it. Him. 

He picked up a second bag, and strolled – strolled! While carrying more than I suspected I could physically lift! - after me. Whatever this thing was, it was from a high-gravity planet.

“I know the drill.” He said. “Pretty sure I'll be leaving this station before long, too.”
“Why would that be?” I asked politely as I ushered him into the private interview corral and activated the privacy field. The sounds of immigration control evaporated as a sudden fuzzy silence engulfed us.
He dropped the bags and they landed with a solid, dense noise that told me they were exactly as heavy as they looked. “It's only a matter of time before your colleagues in security prosecute me for vagrancy” he said.
“Why would they do that?” I asked, to make conversation as I prepared the official forms.
“Article 227, paragraph 16 of the Galactic Treaty of Laws.” He said, stretching out and rolling its head. His endoskeleton issued a loud clicking sound and he issued a sigh that my implant interpreted as pleasure. He laughed, a sound that served the exact same purpose as it did in mine, though this one was tinged with bitterness. “Technically, as a member of a pre-interplanetary species, I am a non-sentient specimen of indigenous fauna and therefore cannot be legally employed or own property.”

I indicated my understanding by nodding - another gesture our body language shared in common- and raising the fur at the nape of my neck. 
“The Corti abducted you, didn't they?”
“My kind call them “Greys”.” he replied. 

I nodded. The Corti were small – even smaller than this being – grey-skinned but with large eyes and oversized brains as a result of a centuries-long eugenics program within their species which had vastly expanded their intellect. Most other species suspected that their sense of empathy had atrophied as a side-effect of the campaign to make themselves smarter. They were known for abducting specimens of a pre-Contact species, experimenting on them to acquire biological data, then using that information to be able to sell cybernetic technology to the newcomers that was appropriate to their biology the second they were welcomed into the galactic fold. Unethical, but the species as a whole could not be prosecuted for the actions of a few and so the sale of the implants went ahead anyway. Kevin Jenkins had clearly been one of their victims.

“Apt.” I said. “Why not have the implant removed and return to your homeworld?”
“Because I'd never be able to keep the secret, and so the Office for the Preservation of Indigenous Species won't let me.” he said. “Can we please start with the official stuff? I haven't slept in two standard Diurnals.”

“I apologise” I said, chagrined at my own lack of professionalism. I activated the corral's recording function “Interview begins, interstellar convenient standard date/time 1196-5-24.4. Civilian trade station 591 “Outlook on Forever”, Customs and Immigration Officer krrkktnkk a'ktnnzzik'tk interviewing immigrant pre-Contact abductee. Could you repeat your identification for me, please?”
“Abductee 907-42-96-53-3 Male. Name - Kevin Jenkins. My species refer to ourselves as 'Human'. Our homeworld is a category twelve temperate at co-”
I interrupted him. “I must ask you to take this interview seriously. Your visa will be denied if you continue to mock the immigration system.”

Its facial feature twisted up into an expression of amusement.

“I assure you officer, I am not mocking the immigration system. My species homeworld really is a category twelve temperate. You will find documentary verification of that fact on this data storage.”

I ripped the data from the storage and attached it to the recording. True to his word, a full survey of the “human” homeworld revealed that it was indeed category twelve – a death world. Hostile, vicious and forever primordial. Experimentally I tried to enter this fact onto the paperwork, which of course threw up an error code.

“It is considered impossible for sentient beings to evolve on category twelve planets” I said. 
“As I explained off the record, according to Article 227 Paragraph 16 of the Galactic Treaty of Laws I am, legally, not a sentient being.” it raised its forelimbs and the torso joints moved in a complicated way, denoting resignation. I gave this some consideration, and scrapped the form. He was quite correct and that status made properly navigating him through the immigration paperwork impossible. The recording would just have to do.

Jenkins nodded, and our implants eventually decided that he meant that a prediction had come true. 
“You can see why the administration on station 442 kicked me out.” he said. “I'm a bureaucratic anomaly. The whole system is far too rigid to accommodate me and mine.”

I caught myself nodding my agreement and shut the gesture down. It would show up on the record and negatively impact my next performance evaluation.
“I get the impression that station 442 is not the only place where you-”

I was interrupted by an alarm. Three short howls of noise – the attack alarm.

“Impossible!” I exclaimed as I leapt out of my chair, and registering the motion the corral shut down our privacy field. The remaining passengers from the shuttle that we had been processing were responding with varying degrees of calmness. Some, more skittish species, were beating a hasty retreat to the shuttle's airlock, while others waited for instructions.

I had not finished gathering my thoughts when there was a sudden violent lurch that knocked me from my feet. I saw Jenkins sway with the motion and remain upright, despite the fact that he was balanced precariously on only two legs. A second alarm began to sound – the long wail of a station damage alarm. This was then followed by the angry growl of a hull breach alarm, but oddly not the decompression alarm.

That could mean only one thing.

“Them? Here?” I asked of nobody as I struggled to my feet and trotted to the weapons locker.
“Them?” Jenkins asked, loping along easily next to me in what was clearly much lower gravity than he was evolved for.

The locker reacted to the security codes my station security officer's harness was broadcasting and opened, spilling out a pair of pulse guns, two personal shield emitters and a magazine of coin-sized nervejam grenades. I slapped the shield emitter to the power dock on my harness. There was no visible change, but the sense tendrils along my back felt a tingling as the shield came online. The pulse gun configured itself for my species as I picked it up and connected its power cable to my harness.

“Hunters.” I whispered.

Jenkins didn't seem especially frightened by the news, but then I realised he had almost certainly never heard of the only carnivorous species in the galaxy that preferred the meat of fellow sentients.

I didn't have time to explain. There was the sound of pulse-gun fire and a squealing being galloped into the customs area before being caught from behind by a kinetic pulse that hurled it to the ground, broken and dying.

Jenkins sprinted for cover, and I followed. Despite my longer legs, he covered the ground faster and threw himself behind a customs booth as another kinetic pulse missed him. I turned and shot at the Hunter that had aimed at us. My shot evaporated harmlessly against a protection field identical to mine. There were three more behind it and I ducked into cover next to the human as their return fire threatened to overwhelm my defences.

“We're in trouble...” I whined. All around us, fleeing and panicking immigrants were being smashed to the ground by Hunter firepower. 
Jenkins popped his head above the countertop and ducked again as a volley of shots targeted him.
“Six of them” he said. “Ugly motherfuckers.”

I had to agree, as I fired a few suppressing shots around the corner. While judging any species by the aesthetic values of your own species doesn't make a lot of sense, Hunters were ugly. Their skin was ceramic-white and wet, and seven eyes, each blinking independently, provided them with exceptional depth perception. On six legs, they were extremely stable, and their forelimbs were cybernetically fused into their heavy pulse guns, making disarming them impossible. These ones were wearing full military combat harness – my own light security harness was no match. Our only hope was the magazine of nervejam grenades, which I realised with a falling sensation of failure I had left in the locker.

“The grenades....” I swore. 
“Only hope?” Jenkins asked. He was holding himself low and hunched, and I could see those dense high-gravity muscles tense and ready under his lightly-furred skin.

I nodded, fighting back the urge to excrete in my terror. If they took us alive, we would be food. By the time I realised that Jenkins had taken off at a flat sprint toward the locker, he was almost a third of the way there.

I knew what I had to do. The Hunters were turning to fire at him as I popped up from cover. They saw me coming but I put three rounds into one and its shield failed against the third. It collapsed, what passed for its face shattered by the impact, and I ducked as its fellows returned fire. One ignored me and kept firing at Jenkins, but he was so fast, so small, and the rounds smacked into the deck plating around him. He threw his feet out ahead of him and slid the last few strides to the locker. He popped up to his feet, looked at me as he raised his arm, and threw, accurately and much, much further than I could have thrown them.

Then a pulse round took him in the torso and flung him against the wall.

I had no time to mourn. I caught the grenades, slipped one from the cylindrical container, counted two light pulses from the indicator around its edge, and threw it toward the enemy on the third. A second later there was a flare of light and shrieking, but it was not enough. Two of the Hunters rampaged past their convulsing comrades, rushing me. I fired, but fear took my aim and the best I managed was a single round that impacted harmlessly against a shield before their return fire broke my own shielding and ruined my arm.

I collapsed, shaking from the pain. The Hunters trotted round the corner, chattering in their deep, guttural language that I couldn't understand. I stared at their twin heavy pulse guns, too afraid even to close my eyes before the end.

It didn't come. Instead something black, blue and brown hurtled into the flank of one of the alien warriors with a crunch and a hiss of pain. It staggered, collided with its comrade and fell.

Jenkins – somehow, impossibly alive despite taking a kinetic pulse round to the chest – wrestled very briefly with the Hunter, and then there was a horrible organic splitting noise, the hiss became a shriek, and the gun was in hands, blood and mangled meat dripping from the cybernetic interface.

The second Hunter snap-fired and Jenkins dropped the gun as the shot winged him. He didn't seem to notice – instead he pounced and a second shot barely missed him before his forepaw lashed out, balled up into a hard knot of gravity-densened bone and flesh which he drove into the Hunter's eye cluster.

It shrieked and flailed, swatting the human with its hindlimbs. He didn't appear to care – instead he caught one of the flailing limbs, braced one of his own feet against the Hunter's flank, and heaved with a roar. There was a grim tearing noise, and the Hunter's leg came away. Its blood sprayed thick and fat through the air, coating the man from the death world but he ignored it. He didn't spare the fallen alien a second glance as he charged at the lone survivor.

It was suicide. The Hunter had a clear shot and took it. Then it took a second. Then a third, and a fourth, and though every single one was on target, Jenkins just kept going, apparently completely impervious to impacts that would have pulped any other species.

Hunters don't wear inter-species communication implants, but I didn't need one to recognise the fear and panic it briefly had time to show before it was beaten to death with another Hunter's severed leg. Jenkins just kept hitting it, again and again, snarling and shouting, ordering it to die and declaring improbable things about its parentage before finally he stopped and stepped away from the broken thing he had made, gulping down great shuddering breaths of what, to him, must have been very thin and dry air. Then he apparently lost the strength to stand and his forelimbs folded up underneath him. His head sank down until the pointed bottom of his jaw was resting against his torso.

I swallowed my pain and staggered to my feet. My arm dangled useless by my side and every slight movement was agony, but I had to know if he was alive.

The all-clear alarm sounded just before I reached him, and he moved in response to it. One of his eyes had swollen and was turning a dark red-purple. But the other blinked at me and his mouth curled upwards at the corners. I saw that one of his teeth was missing.

“Tough bastards.” he said, and spat bright red blood onto the Hunter corpse next to him.

I couldn't help it. I had to laugh.

I found the human Kevin Jenkins in conversation with one of the station's senior lawyers on the public promenade deck. I had been retired from the customs and immigration desk on the docking ring while my injuries were repaired, and instead had spent much of the last three groups of eight standard diurnals dealing with the paperwork and investigative work that had followed the Hunter attack. I had seen him only twice since – once when I saw him on the news feed as galactic media briefly turned their attention to our station and its unusual story, and the second time was when I took his statement for the official incident report.

On the news, his eye had still been swollen and ugly, much of his flesh had darkened and bruised from minor haemorrhaging, and he had been wincing with pain every time he drew breath. When I interviewed him, the swelling had gone down and the pain in his breath had gone away. Now, twenty diurnals after the attack, there was just some greenish discolouration to show that he had ever been injured. My arm, meanwhile, had needed amputating, and I was still adjusting to the plastic and carbon fibre prosthetic that had replaced it. He raised a forelimb and waggled his paw – hand – at me as I approached, and our social cybernetics agreed that this was a gesture of greeting.

“Kirk!” he exclaimed. He was completely unable to pronounce my name, so had taken to approximating the first syllable, with my permission. He was still yet to explain why he had found it so amusing to call me that.
A chair reconfigured itself for my anatomy and I straddled it. Jenkins received no such luxury from the chairs, but seemed comfortable enough anyway.

“I hope I am not interrupting, Lawyer Vedregnenug?” I asked.
“You are not, Officer A'ktnn”, Vedreg replied. He and I were good acquaintances, but his species are sticklers for observing some formalities upon greeting one another. “Purveyor Jenkins and I were discussing his petition to have his species reclassified as sentient.”
“Purveyor Jenkins?” I asked.
“Back on Earth I owned a recreational establishment.” he said, sipping his glass of water. I had noticed already that his water intake was surprisingly high considering his size, and made a note to ask him about it. 
“I assumed you were military.” I told him. He chuckled. 
“Nope.”
“But you were fearless when those Hunters were shooting you!” I exclaimed. He did that complicated joint-lift with his forelimbs again – a “shrug”. 
“How's your arm?” he asked, changing the subject.
“I am adapting to it. Thank you. So you think you may be able to have humans reclassified?”

A wave of purple pigmentation rippled down Vedreg's flank – pessimism. “It would require an amendment to the Galactic Treaty of Laws” he said “Which the council is historically stubborn to tamper with. Amending the Treaty tends to lose votes.”

Jenkins issued a coarse sound through his nasal orifice – derision – but said nothing. He rolled up the sleeves of fabric that covered his forelimbs until they were bunched around the mid-joint. I noticed that a patch of skin on his left arm had been artificially pigmented. It was a simple design – one long line, crossed by a shorter one. 

His skin went bumpy and raised his sparse body fur. His social implant reported no emotional context for that, so I assumed it was an automatic response to some environmental factor. Aliens can be surprisingly strange at the best of times, but I was beginning to suspect that humans may be weirder than most. The medical report from the team that provided care to Jenkins after the battle said that his blood stream contained a powerful combat drug, though I was certain he hadn't ingested, inhaled or injected any during the fight. There hadn't been time. 

Muscles shifted under his thin brown skin as he tapped his digits on the tabletop in a simple one-two-three rhythm. In any other species the movement would have looked obscenely organic.

“Fascinating biology.” Vedred agreed with me, and I indicated embarrassment – clearly I had been displaying my fascination openly enough for my social implant to broadcast it. “How strong ARE you, Purveyor Jenkins?”
Jenkins shrugged “Strong enough to rip the leg off a Hunter and beat another Hunter to death with it.” he said. “I don't know how that translates.”
“I meant by the standards of your own species.” Vedreg clarified.
“Uh... I don't know. I try to stay in shape, but between the low gravity and not getting enough food I've probably lost some muscle... about or slightly below average for a male of my size?” he suggested.

Vedreg and I exchanged a glance that bypassed the social implants. 
“There are going to be a lot of nervous species out there when your kind develop quantum communication” Vedreg opined.
“You have no idea.” Jenkins muttered. The twin patches of fur above his eyes creased inwards and downwards – my translator informed me that this emotion had no equivalent in my species.

“Unarmed, you single-handedly defeated three of the most feared aliens in known space, and you tell us you are neither a trained warrior nor a physically exceptional specimen of your kind. The security footage records you being shot seven times by heavy pulse gun fire and you have fully healed in less than three-times-eight diurnals.” I said. “Many officers have suggested to me that you are a security threat, on the grounds that if you decided to go on a violent rampage, there would be little that could stop you.”
“You have nervejam grenades.” he pointed out.
“Those are lethal.” I replied.
“But they'd work. They gave me a splitting headache from across the room.”

I filed this away as a rebuttal for the next officer to approach me on the subject. At that distance, the nervejam grenades should not have affected him at all. Heightened sensitivity? Then I realised I was treating this man who had saved my life as if he was a threat that I needed to figure out how to kill and suppressed a flash of shame.

“I'm surprised, actually.” Jenkins confessed.
“What by?” Vedreg asked.
“By how easily they broke. I knew I was stronger and tougher than most sentient life, but I had no idea the difference was that big. It's... intimidating. I feel like Superman.”
“Superman?”
“Uh... fiction. From my homeworld. A human who could fly without wings, and who was impossibly strong and utterly impervious to all attempts to harm him. And he used his power to save the world and protect the weak... Well, except he wasn't really a human, he was an alien who looked exactly like a human whose parents sent him to Earth because their own planet was about to be destroyed...” he paused. “Complicated.”
“Every species has fiction.” I pointed out. “Your Superman sounds like T'vnndrkktktk, who defended his herd from a pack of predators for a year without sleeping.”
“Or Gudruvgnagnut, who grew so large that his tribe could shelter beneath him from the year-storm.” said Vedreg. “Though I find it interesting that your greatest hero was not even of your own species.”

“We've always thought of ourselves as weak.” Jenkins said. I couldn't restrain my strangled bleat of disbelief. “Well, by the standards of a lot of species on Earth, we ARE weak. “horses” can carry more, “Dogs” can run further and scent better, most prey species worth hunting could crush an incautious hunter if they turned to fight, and any of the apex predators will happily eat human. Our closest evolutionary cousins are much stronger than us. We just happen to be the ones who figured out brain power, tool use and teamwork to overcome those challenges.”
He scratched his tattoo. “And we have other weakness...”

“What is that?” Vedreg asked. I couldn't tell if he had failed to notice the human's discomfort, or if he simply didn't care.
“Something I've never seen since I first started wandering around all these stations” Jenkins said. “Tell me... did either of your species ever have something called “Ree-lid-jee-on”?”

We gave it a moment's thought.
“My implant can't find an equivalent concept.” Vedreg told him. I gestured that this was true for me also. “what is it?”
“Our greatest weakness.” Jenkins said. “And the reason you guys are going to shit yourselves when humans finally get off the ground”

We listened, and I privately felt a sense of alarm mounting within me. The concept was very, VERY alien. Humans, it seemed, had for most of their sentient era preferred to invent explanations for the world around them rather than admit a lack of knowledge. They had invented a sentience that was capable of doing any logically consistent thing, capable of knowing anything. Rather than answer the mystery of where they had come from, they had historically preferred to tell stories and then convince themselves that the stories were true. If Jenkins was to be believed, then the line between fantasy and reality was, for many humans, invisible.

He told us of the myth he had grown up being told was real. How this great power - “God” - had made the universe in a handful of diurnals, and crafted the first humans from the dirt of their homeworld. They had disobeyed him, and been punished. As had their descendants, and THEIR descendants, until apparently one tribe had tortured this being's physical avatar to death – he gestured to the tattoo at this point, explaining that it depicted a crucifix, the very instrument of torture in question. This act somehow convinced this “God” thing to forgive them and be nice to humanity so long as they devoted considerable time and effort to telling it how great it was.

Vedreg had turned a grim shade of worried dark green by the time Jenkins finished telling the story.
“So... this “God” created humans, got angry at them, condemned them to be tortured forever and ever after death, and then had itself sacrificed to itself to save mankind from the very torture it was inflicting upon them?” he asked.
“Yes” My social implant tentatively suggested that Jenkins' body language communicated tired endurance.
“And humans believe that this is the real way in which the history of your species unfolded?”
“About a third of us still do, yes.”

We were silent for some time. Vedreg slowly went bluer and bluer until suddenly he erupted.
“WHY?!” he demanded. 
“I don't know.” Jenkins responded, calmly.
“You don't know? You're wearing the symbol of this... this masochism on your arm and you don't know why your people believe it?”
“I know why I believed it.” he said. “I didn't know any better.”
“But...!”
“I was taught this thing from a very young age as if it was true. I had no reason to believe I was being lied to, so I accepted it. It took me half my life to realise that the people who taught me this thing didn't have to be lying, they could just be wrong.” He swallowed the last of his glass of water. “When I told my family that I had stopped believing that the God myth was true, they accused me of being evil and severed all contact with me. I had to go to civilian law enforcement before most of my property was returned. I was actually driving back from talking with my lawyer about fighting for the right to have contact with my own offspring when I was abducted.”

He looked me in the eye. “You have to understand... I come from one of the MORE civilized parts of my planet.”

Vedreg and I sat in silence for several minutes, absorbing this news. Jenkins, if anything, seemed grateful for the silence.
“That is... deeply troubling information, Purveyor Jenkins.” Vedreg said, eventually. “It implies that your entire species is insane.”
“I don't disagree.” Jenkins replied. 
“And you're strong, fast, impervious to pulse fire-” 
“Not impervious, just highly resilient.” I corrected.
“Have a gland that generates combat drugs....”

I looked at Jenkins, surprised. He did that shrug thing again, this time wobbling his head apologetically. Vedreg kept going, apparently oblivious to the exchange.

“And now you tell me that your species is gripped by the fervent belief that a tale of breathtaking violence and cruelty is all true, and that many of you are willing to die in service to the principal VILLAIN of this story? I'm going to have a hard time convincing anybody that your people should be declared sentient so long as this state of affairs continues.”
“Let me tell you why you need to try.” Jenkins said, quietly.
“Why?”
The human gave a worried smile. “Because if you don't, you won't be ready for us.” He said.

In hindsight, I really should have expected that Jenkins would have attracted a journalist's attention. Within hours, our conversation was on a major interstellar newsfeed with an alarming headline. Clips from it were discussed on political discussion broadcasts, most of them chosen to show the worst possible take on what Jenkins had been saying.

Three diurnals later, the council convened a special meeting. I was part of the security force that flew Jenkins to Capitol Station to be interviewed by a special committee. I wasn't permitted to witness the interview, but every being that entered that chamber exited displaying the signs of worry and stress.

Events moved quickly after that. A civilian fleet set out to make contact with Earth in the hopes of talking them out of this “religion” nonsense. It was met at the edge of their solar system by a Hunter fleet that had apparently been preparing to divert a comet in-system to hit Earth. The navy arrived to break up the fight, but only after horrible casualties to the civilians. The incident prompted the council to do two things: first they passed an amendment to the Treaty that allowed for a species to be declared sentient if it had developed calculus, rather than interplanetary FTL, though the Contact Prohibition would remain in effect until the species went interplanetary.

The second thing it prompted was the declaration of a surveillance and research mission to Earth. I requested, and was granted, a transfer and promotion to head of security on the research station. The station jumped into the Earth system five eight-diurnals after the mission was announced, using the bulk of a large ringed gas world known as “Saturn” to mask the neutrino burst of its arrival. Sheathed in a stealth field that bent all electromagnetic radiation around itself, and using centripetal spin rather than generated gravity, it was designed to go completely undetected. The last thing the station did before activating this field was to spit two probes that embedded themselves in Earth's lone, large moon so as to snoop on Earth's communications networks and forward the information to us via FTL comms, erasing the light-lag.

We would have begun sooner, if the station had not been fitted with a specialist living module for Jenkins and two other human abductees who had requested a place on the mission. Mounted on a trio of boom arms well out from the main body of the station, it provided the higher gravity their species was used to, as well as a warmer, denser, more humid atmosphere. I visited it only once - aside from being 50% heavier than usual, I swiftly felt the heat and humidity making me unwell and returned to the core of the station, which was tuned to the interstellar norm I was used to.

The other humans were quite dissimilar to Jenkins. Charlotte was from the same landmass and political entity as he was, but was older than him and had apparently joined the mission so as to preach the “truth” of the very religion we were there to study. Most of the crew found it impossible to believe that she was not insane, but Jenkins assured me that her beliefs were considered perfectly normal. He seemed embarrassed by the fact. The other, a male called Jung, pointed out a peninsula on the prograde end of the largest land mass when asked where his home was. He refused to be drawn on the subject of religion, instead preferring to compensate for the gaps in Jenkins' and Charlotte's knowledge regarding that region of their planet.

We spent a lot of time monitoring the political situation at first. Both Jenkins and Charlotte expressed surprise at the skin tone of the elected leader of their home faction. They got into a vicious argument about a war in a dry, hot part of the world that had apparently only just started when they were abducted. Jenkins later explained to me that Charlotte had praised what she saw as a war between her own religion against another, rival one. 

“It's crazy”. He complained to me, in private. “They're both products of the same religious root anyway!”

I began to suspect, however, that Jenkins had not been entirely fair about his own species. My job was trivially easy, so I spent much of my time browsing the content of their worldwide data network. Whenever Jenkins was with me, I noticed that he had a habit of focusing on the worst aspects. It was when I started to explore without his guiding hand that I started to find the positives.

I had never paid much attention to poetry, art and fiction. Those things exist in all species, but the alien concepts these things expressed, and the way in which they expressed them, broke through that barrier for me. Some, I couldn't stand – monotonous, pulsing music that seemed to delight in going nowhere, broadcasts which appeared to take a morbid fascination in the opinions of beings that, among my own species, would have been locked up for their own safety and medicated. Other specimens of their art were interesting, thought-provoking. A few inspired quite intense emotions in me. I enjoyed watching their movies, and Jenkins and I spent nearly a full diurnal watching first a series of enjoyable fantasies called “Star Wars”, then a trilogy called “The Lord of the Rings” which I then discovered had originally been a book and read. 

Our musical tastes were different – he introduced me to his favourite genres, which I found shallow and noisy, he disliked the ones that most inspired me. I had trouble understanding how somebody could hear the music written by Khachaturian, Tchaikovsky, Bach and Rutter and consider them “dull”, but other members of the crew reported that they preferred Jenkins' taste in music. Whatever else it was, Earth was a rich source of artistic exports.

It was also a fountain of though-provoking philosophy, novel ideas and unique pastimes. Human words started to slip into the languages of the station's crew, filling gaps in our philosophical vocabulary. Once every eight-diurnals, five of the crew could be found gathered around a table in the mess hall, rolling number polyhedra and apparently immersed in fantastical battles against impossible creatures that could breath fire, or turn a warrior to stone by meeting its gaze. Another group borrowed the idea of “poetry reading” and took it in turns to stand up and read their compositions aloud – an exercise doomed to ridiculousness by the fact no two of them spoke the same language, but they took to it with enthusiasm. I had to gently ask the scientists to stop gambling on the outcome of human contests of physical skill and endurance, or to at least exercise some moderation.

As part of my job, I was required to pass information of potential military significance back to the Council. The concept of the “taser” was among the very first. The idea of the “suicide bomber” was alarming, and caused something of a stir when it was presented to the committee for interstellar security, who called an emergency session to think up means by which such an insane tactic could be countered. In the end, they wound up stealing the best ideas from humanity itself.

It was only when I encountered the idea of the “tortured poet” that things started to fall into place. Up until that point, I had been struggling to reconcile the artistic power of these beings, and the nobility of their heroic visions of themselves, with the relentless delusion and grinding unpleasantness enacted in its name that played out before me. Now I began to see the shape of it. The “Demons” - a loan-word that had filled a conceptual gap we had never been aware of – that tormented humanity were what inspired it. Surrounded on all sides by an ecosystem saturated with toxic microfauna and parasitic nanoorganisms, by vicious predators, hardy prey and an explosively unstable tectonic world, they sacrificed their own peace of mind on the altar of evolution.

They are... not crazy. They are something far more than that. They are tortured geniuses. When they finally get off their world in a meaningful way, when they finally become eligible for contact and for introduction into the interstellar community, we will need to handle them with utmost care.

They are physically powerful. Their firearms might not penetrate modern shielding, but our own weaponry will hardly slow them down, and believe me they will adapt and overcome. The chemical weapons they use as less-lethal alternatives would slaughter us. The water cannons they use to suppress riots would pulverize our bones. They are not only willing to die in the name of a fiction, they will do so gladly and eagerly. They are mentally overwhelming – their ideas are powerful, their inventiveness puts us to shame, their philosophy explores avenues of thought that simply never occurred to us.

But the most important part is that they must never, ever learn how much superior they are to us in so many ways. I think the idea would break them. 

You see, Earth is a death world. To survive, they had to evolve not just intelligence, but the ability to apply it like a weapon. They didn't evolve to merely overcome adversity – they evolved to thrive on it. They NEED to have something to aspire to, something they think is bigger than they are. They need something to fight. Without a challenge, I think they very swiftly get depressed.

Kevin Jenkins did. I didn't see it at the time, but I think that getting into space and finding that he could rip the limbs off its worst terrors really upset him. He never told me why he asked to have his social implant removed, and why he went back to Earth. But I can guess.

He did it because there are more challenges down there among his own kind than he would ever find up here, among us.

Understand this is my first time writing anything, so any criticism is appreciated (or if its just awful you can say that too). Also, because it was originally what gave me this idea, this story is set in the same universe as [The Tale of Kevin Jenkins](http://redd.it/2ftcpy) (Thank /u/f3lbane for the good quality), but happens shortly before Kevin Jenkins' tale does, and is distinctly apart from it.

Dear journal,

Fuck. My. Life. 

I'll start with what happened right before my life decided that I wasn't getting enough excitement. It was 2:00 in the morning, the bar had just closed . . . at least for me, so I was making my not-too-steady way towards home. I think I made a wrong turn somewhere, unless the way from the bar to my house had suddenly decided to include a dark alley. There was a bright light. I blacked out.

I woke up strapped to a gurney. At least, that's what I would have preferred it to be in hindsight. Nurses usually look a little better than what was at my bedside, and I've seen some nurses with quite a bit of personality. Rather, waiting to wish me a happy good morning, was a creature straight out of science fiction. It was about three feet tall, papery skin the color of ash, a bulbous, elongated head far too large for its thin body, and large amber eyes the size of golf-balls. Just to make my well-wisher that much more comforting, its eyes didn't appear to have any pupils. 

Given the circumstances, I was somewhat discombobulated as to my current location and as to the nature of my visitor, so I politely asked him to explain. What came out of my mouth may have sounded more like "What the fuck are you, where the hell am I, and why am I strapped down," but I don't think he understood what I said. I quickly stifled those last two questions as he raised an odd looking syringe and stuck it in my arm. I hadn't finished my uncomplimentary statement about the circumstances of his birth before I was out again. 

I swear I don't pass out this often on most days. I really wished I hadn't passed out that last time because I opened my eyes to the bars of a cage. Upon surveying my surroundings, I found I was in a kennel with quite a few other creatures which, if the little grey Yoda hadn't been enough, were evidence that I had been abducted by aliens. It wasn't long before I realized that I was being studied, along with the rest of the animals in the other cages. At first I had hoped they were sentient. Then I saw one of the other inmates ignore his perfectly acceptable daily nutrient supplement in favor of his feces. My aspirations for the other inmates died in similarly disgusting fashions. The other thing that told me that I was different from the rest of the creatures was my cage. All of their cages appeared relatively simple to open, or even break. I was reasonably sure that most of the cages wouldn't have been able to hold a sufficiently determined chihuahua. My cage, on the other hand, was fort Knox without all the gold. Aside from the traditional vertical bars, there were thick horizontal supports, braced by a mesh, encased in a glass box. I was flattered that they thought I warranted such high security, but I doubted it was necessary. 

They apparently did not share my opinions, and every time they decided to take me out for testing, they gassed my box with something that put my lights out like a two by four, except without the bruise. That was my life for the next two weeks or so. I can't say exactly how long, since I couldn't see the sun, and I didn't have my watch or any of the other things I'd had in my pockets. By the second week I wasn't looking too good. That, coupled with the fact that I was gassed unconscious every two sleeping periods, made my mood something south of sour. By that time I was starting to be able to recognize the different xenos by height and build. 

I counted seven different aliens who would come into the room and either gas my box or do something to one of the other animals, and from the aliens behavior, I could see they were all jerks. All but one. The others seemed to enjoy inflicting pain, or at least didn't feel bad about it, but the shortest (I called him Stumpy) seemed to try to create as little discomfort as possible. If, on the rare occasion, one of the animals had to be put down and he had to do it, Stumpy always seemed sad as he injected the blue syringe of death (my name for it again) into the doomed creature, petting it as it faded away. 

That's why I was slightly more than alarmed when, at the beginning of the third week, he entered the room with the blue syringe of death in his hands and started walking towards my box. He hit the button and gas began to leak into my chamber. This time, I didn't take it sitting down. I actually stood up and started attacking the bars with more energy then I'd shown for a while. Stumpy seemed stunned by my sudden outburst, as I'd never been this frantic before. Maybe it was because my heart was trying to escape the body it thought would not need its services much longer. Maybe there was less gas, but I wasn't knocked unconscious, only paralyzed. Waiting until he was sure that I wasn't able to move, Stumpy opened my chamber door, and knelt by my head. I tried to move, but wasn't even able to lift a finger as he inserted the needle into my neck. The lights faded. 

I didn't die. Shocker, I know, since I'm writing this, but when I woke up, my body felt like the static from an old TV and I was, once again, on a gurney. The only difference, though, was that the alien by my bedside wasn't a meter tall and grey, but towered over me to something to the tune of four meters, had four legs, two arms, light blue skin stripped with a darker blue, and was making frantic clicking noises to another one. As I looked around, I saw there were quite a few of these new aliens by my bedside, all intent upon the heated clicking battle between the first two. These others were somewhat shorter than the two who were arguing, and also appeared less . . . developed. Or maybe they were more developed, I don't know how these things age. With what happened next, though, I would have given up a bath and some good food to have known what they were saying. 

 _________________________________________________________________________________________________


"I want that thing off my ship this instant!" Tnnxz shout-clicked. "We don't know what happened on that Corti ship, and I say it's best not to borrow trouble when you don't have to." He had been in favor of giving the doomed ship a wide berth, but Xkkrk, his favorite mating partner and second in command, though she liked to forget that at opportune moments, had thought differently. 

"That ship was transmitting a distress beacon, venting atmosphere, and well on its way to complete hull failure." shouted Xkkrk. "We're the only ship out here for light-years, but you would have had us act as though we hadn't heard it? If we'd done that we might as well have murdered them ourselves!"

Tnnxz snorted. "They didn't need any help in *that* regard. Do you honestly mean to tell me you think the crew of that science vessel died by naturally tearing their own limbs off and bashing in their own skulls? I don't think a one of them was fully intact, and that's just the ones you could recognize as having once been alive. The others were just smears, if the records about there being a full crew of seven were to be believed. What do you think did that? The animals who were all in their cages, or the one, living, breathing, *uneviscerated* abomination on that ship?"

"You think *this* killed them?" Xkkrk motioned toward the strange creature on the ship's one medical bed. She had to admit one thing, it was rather strange to look at. Its pink, squishy skin was covered in a sparse black fur, except for its head, which seemed to be compensating for the rest of the body in the hair department. It was short, somewhat less than half her height, yet it looked dense. She suspected it was stronger than its size suggested, but not so strong as to be able to turn the crew of a Corti zoological vessel into a pulp. "It may have been breathing when we found it, but it wasn't doing much else. Do you think it slaughtered the crew, then fell asleep in a ship which was leaking atmosphere? It's been awake since you started yelling," Tnnxz jumped and quickly looked at the creature in alarm, but she kept going, "and it hasn't moved a muscle. If it were going to attack us it would have done it by now."

"It's a dumb beast, it didn't know the ship was compromised. And it was right next to that headless body holding an empty RotGut syringe."

"Oh, so aside from being able to turn a Corti crew into a fine mist, it's now able to survive a bio-engineered pathogen able to kill every known organism in a few seconds. Next you'll be telling me it can make you last longer than a few [minutes] next time we're alone together." The comment obviously stung him, but Xkkrk could see he knew she was right. The children, who had been listening intently to the conversation, could also see that she had won. Xkkrk could see the youngest, Vtv, was about to ask the same question he had when they'd first found the creature. 

"So." He clicked, "Can we keep him?"

Dear Journal,

I'm a xeno dog. 

Believe it or not, that hasn't helped my self-esteem issues. Good thing I don't have any. I came to the revelation slowly. After the two blue-giraffes (I'm rather proud of that name) finished up their spitting argument, one of the underdeveloped ones, which I'm now sure are children, clicked a few times. Apparently it was a sentence, because the larger two looked at him, then, despite the fact that it was just a bunch of clicks, one of the adults, a female I think, delivered what was unmistakeably a mother's lecture. The little one jumped up and down in his excitement, not listening to a click she was saying. Eventually she finished up, and it seemed as though something had been decided. Everyone vacated the room, except for the smallest one, who I quickly named Dinklage (not my best, but I was rushed). He moved closer, and I suddenly began to wonder what these creatures ate. They looked harmless enough, but then so had the grey Yodas. 

Dinklage looked down at me, and once again I tried to move my limbs. Their only response was to twitch my smallest finger. Thanks guys. I needn't have worried though, because Dinklage suddenly scampered out of the room with the all the grace of a dying gazelle, where I was left to contemplate my immobility and the nature of my position. By this time I was pretty sure I was in space. I hadn't seen a window, but unless the Men in Black films had been documentaries, I doubted I was still on Earth. It was a shame, too, since no one would be looking after my house. 

I didn't have much time to ponder my ruined estates, because Dinklage explosively burst back into the room, holding what looked like a speckled blue and yellow palm frond, which he promptly shoved unceremoniously into my face.  I looked at him, hoping for some explanation, but his only response was to shove it further. We sat in that position for awhile, myself, lying prone upon the bed, palm frond in my face, child blue-giraffe looking at me expectantly. After about a minute of that he deflated, then turned and flailed out of the room again, returning a minute later with what looked like a black and rotting fungus. The newest plant specimen was also displayed for my inspection. Unfortunately the fungus smelled about as revolting as it looked. This process was repeated several times. After I was shown a lovely flower the color of bird shit, Dinklage, who had been growing increasingly frustrated with the proceedings, snorted like a horse, and seemed to wither in defeat. He shuffled out of the room, and I was finally left in peace. 
__________________________________________________________________________________________________

Vtv, shoulders slumped in defeat, sulked onto the bridge. Xkkrk, who had been worried this would happen, turned sympathetically towards him. "He won't eat any of the things I gave him," Vtv mumbled. "He even turned down the aged zrrks, and even Yxrrq will eat those. Why doesn't he like any of our food?"

"Maybe he just wasn't all that hungry. Maybe he was scared of you. Just think of what you look like to him. He's so much smaller than you. You loom over him. He just has to warm up to you. Why don't you go into his room and play a game of warrens with Piiqrrt. Maybe if the creature gets used to seeing you he'll trust you enough to let you feed him." Xkkrk smiled as Vtv, presented with a new course of action, regained his excitement and tore out of the room, the picture of a youth with too many things to do.  
__________________________________________________________________________________________________

My peace was once again disturbed as Dinklage walked purposefully back into my room, followed by another child carrying what looked like a small metal clam. This new blue-giraffe was significantly larger than Dink, and I doubted the extra bulk was muscle. Both he and Dink sat on the floor with the clam in between them, and as the new child sat, his excess weight bounced, confirming my suspicions and earning him the christening of Jiggles. Jiggles opened the clam, and a holographic projection of what was unmistakeably a game board leapt into existence between them. It was a grid of hexagons, with different colored pieces on the two of the opposite sides, closest to the players. Dink seemed to have an unfair advantage over Jiggles, though, because his side had well over twenty pieces while Jiggles only seemed to have three. 

It didn't seem to make much of a difference. Within minutes of the game's start, Dink's body language began to tell of a losing battle, which was confirmed by the quickly diminishing number of his pieces. Seemingly at random, certain hexagons on the playing field would glow brighter than the rest, then dim several turns later, for reasons I couldn't understand. Neither the glowing hexes, nor the greater number of pieces saved Dink. After only seven minutes of game play, all his pieces had been systematically removed from the board. The game was reset, yet this time Dink had the three pieces, while Jiggles had the army. I soon realized that the player with three pieces had to capture all the pieces of the other players before the other player was able to reach one of the glowing hexagons with one of his pieces. The glowing hexagons seemed to appear only in positions that were difficult for the defensive player to reach, and soon I was engrossed in the game, trying to parse out any remaining rules. Jiggles won most of the games, which allowed me to see how the game could be won by both sides. 

It wasn't the most complex of games, but it did include a strategy. After five or so games, I began to see the flaws in Dink's strategy, and decided he wasn't the brightest blue-giraffe I'd ever seen. Jiggles wasn't even that good. I wished more than ever that I could speak to him, if for no other reason than to yell at him in frustration. His pieces were once again eliminated, and the game began again. I couldn't let him lose this one. I struggled against my paralysis, and managed to shift my arm until it fell off the bed, hanging limply by the side of the bed. My movement drew their attention. Dink sprang to his feet and excitedly scampered out of the room. He returned with the speckled palm frond from before, eagerly introducing it to my face. 

"Get your leaf out of m-" I didn't manage to finish my sentence though, as with the opening of my mouth, he surged forward with the frond and managed to poke it past my lips. I tried to spit it out, but he kept attempting to feed it to me. That's when it dawned on me that that was what he was trying to do. With that realization came the second, significantly more profound realization. They thought I was an animal! They didn't realize that I was sentient. And what was even worse, I couldn't tell them. My speech would sound like so much grunting and unintelligible nonsense as their clicking. They didn't use the same numeric system, so I couldn't show them my powers of abstract reasoning through math, which, admittedly, were extremely lacking. I was an unthinking brute, and what was even worse, I had been given to Dink for him to take care of. I was Dink's new puppy, and he was trying to find out what I ate. Well, I *was* famished. Don't bite the hand that feeds you, which seemed to take on a greater significance in my new situation. I just wished that hand wasn't blue, or striped, or belonged to a giraffe child. It would have to suffice.

Armed with this knowledge, I took a bite from the tip of the leaf. I don't know what palm fronds taste like, but they probably would have tasted better. I spat out the bitter leaf, but this only seemed to make Dink happier. He bolted from the room, and returned with the rotten mushroom. I wasn't about to let that get anywhere near my tongue, and I firmly closed my lips against the melting brown mush. The next leaf he brought tasted like romaine lettuce, so I ate the whole thing. It only seemed to increase my hunger. Dink seemed overjoyed and next brought me a container slightly larger than a shoebox full of those leaves. I would have objected to his feeding me if I'd been able to move my arms, but decided that food was good enough. He seemed surprised when I finished off the box of leaves, but dutifully brought me another, which I polished off like the last one. He began to look concerned as I worked my way through the third and fourth containers. What can I say, salad isn't really something to fill a guy up. 

Half way through the fifth helping my hunger was finally sated. Dink seemed to take the box away with relief, and returned with a small glass of water. After the salad I was even thirstier than I had been, and downed the water in a gulp. "You don't happen to have anything stronger than water, do you? Or maybe just a larger glass?" He didn't answer, obviously, and brought me another glass. I downed eight of those pitiful little things before I was quenched. Full for the first time in weeks, I contentedly closed my eyes for a nap, and Dink, thankfully, left me alone. 
__________________________________________________________________________________________________
"How'd the game with Piiqrrt go?" Xkkrk asked as Vtv walked into her quarters

"I lost, but that's ok. Piiqrrt almost beat Fttfk last [week], and *he's* the best warrens player in the entire *sector*! Oh, I also found out what he eats." Announced Vtv, not needing to specify whom "he" was.

"Excellent. See, he just had to get used to you. What does he like?"

"He really likes Cqcq leaves. *Really* likes them. *Really*, *REALLY* likes them. He ate four and a half storage containers worth."

"*Four* *and* *a* *half* *STORAGE* *CONTAINERS*?! That's enough to feed a grown Vzk'tk for a week! Why did you feed him so many?" 

"I just kept feeding him until he stopped eating."

"Vtv, you know better than that. Some animals don't know when to stop eating, they'll just keep going if you let them. You'll have to limit him to half a bowl a day. If you keep feeding it a weeks worth of rations, the hydroponics bay won't be able to produce enough to feed the rest of us."

"But I hate Cqcq leaves."

"Not everyone hates them, and they're one of the best sources of energy we have on board. How the creature managed to down four and a half containers of those leaves is beyond me. Did you give him something to drink?"

"Yeah, he drank [32 ounces] of water." 

"And he didn't drown?"

"Come to think of it, he did close his eyes after the last cup, but I think he was sleeping." 

"Well, You've done a good job of taking care of him. I'm proud of you." Vtv perked up with the compliment, and strutted proudly out of the room. Xkkrk wasn't as pleased though. She quickly sought out Tnnxz and told him of Vtv's discovery. 

"Four and a half containers!? And [32 ounces]?! I don't care if the thing didn't know when to stop eating, that's impossible. It's so small, how could its stomach even hold that much? Does food just *dissolve* in it?" He clicked with a snort, scoffing at such a ridiculous notion. Not for the first time Xkkrk wished Tnnxz was wealthy enough to afford a proper biomedical scanner so she could see inside this creature, but wishes were all she had. 

"What if that's actually how much it needs to eat and drink in order to live? We can't lose a week's worth or rations every day. We have enough water, but I think Vtv was exaggerating. Even if this thing really did eat four and half containers, it couldn't possibly manage [32 ounces] of something as dense as water." 

"But if it truly eats that much, we can't keep it."

"Where would we put it? There aren't any planets below a level 12 within a week of travel, and we might as well kill it ourselves than put it on a deathworld."

"We'd put it down. We'd have to. There'd be no other choice."

"If it comes to that, then I feel sorry for Vtv, he's so happy with it."

"He'll have to become used to loss eventually. Has he even named it yet?"

"Yes. After he saw how much it liked Cqcq leaves, he called it Cqcq'trtr."

"Cqcq'[eater]? Does he have an imagination?"

"He was proud of it, so I suggest you don't mock his choice."

"Fine, but if it lives up to its namesake, it'll be a shame Vtv named it at all."

Dear Journal, 

I destroy xeno familial relationships.

Oh, and I might be going crazy.

After two sleeping periods - I've stopped even trying to keep track of the days - my body had finally decided to end its extended vacation, and start responding to my commands. I felt weak, probably because the only thing I'd been fed so far was *fucking* *salad*, but I was able to get out of the unnecessarily high bed. I'm only 175 centimeters tall, so I was going to have to get used to an environment where the next sentient being closest to my height was almost a meter taller than me. The gravity on the ship was noticeably weaker than what I was used to, which only confirmed my earlier suspicions about being on a ship, but it also helped with the short drop from the bed.

Once I decided that I was able to walk without much trouble, I jumped back onto my bed and waited for Dink to show up with my meal. That's the other reason I think I'm feeling weak. Last sleeping period he only gave me one meal, if it could be called that. He only gave me half of one of those large shoe boxes, and then started to take it away. I tried to use my newly liberated arms to keep him from taking it, but they were still unbelievably sluggish in responding, and he managed to snatch it away in time. "Whoa there Dink, I wasn't finished there. You can't expect me to be full after a ninth of a serving of lettuce! I'm not a rabbit, damn it. I'm a grown man and I need my lettuce! Or better yet, do you have some meat? I'd love some meat if you have any." I told you I was going crazy. Three weeks of hearing nothing but chitters from the grey Yoda's and clicks from the blue-giraffes is bound to make a guy start talking to himself, if for no other reason than to hear something he understands. 

Dink apparently hadn't been impressed by my outburst, and he had clicked reproachfully. If he had gotten a newspaper and tried to swat me with it I wouldn't have been half surprised, but thankfully he didn't know how to properly train a pet. Good thing too, since there was only so much I was willing to endure in order to get food and water. I waited for what seemed an hour, but was probably only about 10 minutes before Dink entered my room with two of those shot glasses filled with water and a shoebox of lettuce. "Oh great, I was hoping for lettuce again. Nothing sets my mouth a-watering like a good crisp piece of lettuce. You even brought me a few gulps of water, just how I like it. You know me so well" I had decided since they couldn't understand me, I might as well make the best of my situation and lace everything I said with sarcasm. Despite the repetition, I decided to eat the lettuce. It was the same box he had used yesterday, and there was no reason to try and snatch it out of his hands, since there was only half of it left. I drank every last drop of water from the two glasses, holding the second one out with a pleading gesture. 

Maybe he understood, maybe he didn't. It didn't matter either way, as he merely clicked something at me and started retreating back to the door. "Fine then, I'll just find my own lettuce and water." I muttered at his retreating back. I waited a few minutes after he had left, then jumped back down from the bed, and walked over to the door. It had an oddly shaped but easily recognizable door handle mechanism, and, when tested, wasn't locked. After all, who bothers locking their dog into a room? Luckily, I had two things dogs don't have. Brains and thumbs. Grinning mischievously, I jumped at the handle which was about 25 centimeters above my head. To my astonishment, my jump carried me past easy reach of the handle and peaked when I was approximately a meter off the ground. Even in my weakened state, I was still able to jump ridiculously high in this lowered gravity. Adjusting for my new found basketball skills, I hopped, turned the handle, and began to explore my new home.

"Are you sure I can't give him more food?" whined Vtv. "He really seems to be hungry. He keeps looking at the box like he wished there was more in it."

"Absolutely not," snapped Tnnxz. Vtv had known it was a mistake to go to Tnnxz with this question. He still seemed to think Cqcq'trtr had killed all those scientists on that ship [three days] ago, as if he could. He barely even moved. Vtv didn't want to say it, but he was definitely feeling the excitement of owning a pet starting to fade, especially such a lazy pet. He was hoping that if he could get him more food, maybe he'd show a little more life. After all, he had certainly started moving more since that first day with the five storage containers, although feeding himself and trying to grab the container away from Vtv was not a significantly large improvement. Still, Vtv had been impressed with Cqcq'trtr's speed as he had grabbed at the box. Vtv almost hadn't gotten it away in time. "If you start feeding it more food, it will begin to feel entitled to it and then we'll have it eating us out of house and hull. I'll not have our resources drained because you don't know when to say 'no'." 

Vtv should have just waited until Xkkrk had woken up so he could have asked her the question. At least she recognized that Cqcq'trtr was a "he" and not an "it". Tnnxz's comlink beeped, signaling an incoming call. "What is it?" he huff-clicked, annoyed.

Strrk, one of the gardeners in the hydroponics bay, could be heard on the other side of the comlink. "Sorry to bother you Tnnxz, but that thing we brought onto the ship a few days ago - what does the kid call it?"

"Cqcq'trtr!" shouted Vtv into his father's receptor before Tnnxz could say anything. He glared at Vtv, but didn't contradict him. 

"Right. Well, you gave him the right name, kid. He's in the hydroponics bay with us right now, and it looks like he's aiming to eat every Cqcq leaf we have. He's already stripped three whole plants, and is half way through his fourth. He's been making these weird groaning and spitting sounds the whole time too. What do you want us to do? He looks pretty determined, and I don't want to touch him, he's filthy."

"Just don't let it leave," growled Tnnxz, looking murderous. "I'll be right there." He sprang from his favorite chair, left his quarters, and stalked towards the aft of the ship, where the hydroponics bay was located. Vtv knew what kind of temper Tnnxz could have when provoked, and knew he harbored no love for Cqcq'trtr. Sometimes Vtv wondered if Tnnxz even liked *him*. Vtv quickly ran to Xkkrk's quarters. He didn't care if he had to wake her up, she was the only one who seemed to defend Cqcq'trtr, if only for his sake.

>>> [OC] Humans don't Make Good Pets [III.II] <<<
"Sorry about scaring you there mates, but a guy can't live off of half a shoe box of lettuce a day, can he? No-sir-ee he needs a good five boxes. That's what my mom always told me, 'five boxes of alien lettuce a day helps you keep the pangs of starvation away' or something like that." The blue-giraffes who were watching me warily didn't seem to appreciate my humor. I knew I wasn't that good, but they could have at least pretended to be amused. I think they were the caretakers, since they had been watering various alien plants when I'd peaked inside. Through my explorations I had decided this was a cargo ship, as a majority of the ship was merely massive rooms piled high with crates with blue-giraffe writing on them. One of the rear cargo bays, though, seemed to have been converted into a hydroponics bay, which hinted at how long this ship took between ports. 

Thankfully, the gardeners had seemed too surprised or too scared of me to try and stop me as I found a plant with familiar looking leaves and began to trim it down. I guess each shoe box had held one plant's worth of leaves, because I went through three of them and was still hungry. I guess lettuce doesn't keep you as full as meat, which is a shame, since I was beginning to think there wasn't any meat on this entire ship. I was three quarters of the way through my fourth plant when the door burst open and one of the adults who had been arguing by my bedside tore into the room. Well, he gallop-flailed at a leisurely pace, but from the looks of it he was giving it all he had. I didn't need to understand his clicks to know that he was angry, especially since he was gesticulating wildly at the three barren plants to my right and the broken off leaf in my hand. 

After a while of shout-clicking and waving his arms about, he feel silent, glaring at me as though waiting for a response. I saw no reason to refuse him one. "I know how bad this looks, but let me assure you, I'm not the rabbit-human you're looking for." Its almost like he knew that what I had said was a poor attempt at a joke, because he burst into another click-rant. Just before I was sure he was going to spit me to death, the other adult who had been arguing that night entered the room, followed by Dink.

The two adults started arguing again, which I was beginning to think was the defining factor in their relationship, and Dink shuffled over to me. He looked at the stripped plants with what I could have sworn was respect, and then turned a disappointed stare on me. I almost felt a little ashamed. "Look Dink, you have to understand, I need more than just a few hundred grams of lettuce to keep me alive. I know you don't know any better, but if we're going to live together, we'll need to get some things straightened out between us, like how often and how much I need to eat and drink." My placatory speech was lost on him though, and I turned my attention back to the arguing adult-blue-giraffes. 

The situation seemed to be degenerating. I couldn't tell you why, but I got a bad vibe from the first one that had entered the room. He reminded me of my Dad, who had yelled at me when I had tried to help him mow the lawn when I was too small to safely operate the old and heavy push mower. I had been hoping to surprise him when he got back from work, since he hated mowing the lawn when he got back home after a long day. To help me move the mower, I had activated it's automatic drive function, but it had gotten away from me and driven off into the garden before I could take off the clip which held the stop lever. When he'd seen the state the garden was in he had been so furious I had hid in my closet rather than go face him during dinner. I don't know why, but I felt the same temper and reckless mannerisms from this blue-giraffe, which earned him the nickname I'd given my father when I was young:  Severus.

If Severus had been angry before, he was livid now. Some of his gesticulations threatened to make him lose his balance. The other adult, however, wasn't having any of Severus' shit, from the looks of it. She was giving Severus the same look of disappointment Dink had given me, albeit a little less condescending. She was so much like a mom that I couldn't help but name her Mama Giraffe. Something Severus said made Dink's ears perk up, then led *him* to join the spitting contest, which served to only enrage Severus even more. He started directing his anger at Dink. I understood a father's anger all too well, and moved to redirect it onto me. 

"Whoa, cool your jets there Severus, it's not Dink's fault tha-" I guess Severus was closer to losing control than I had though, because my sudden insertion into the conversation made Severus whirl around in rage, his eyes thunderbolts. Then, he surprised us all. He aimed a kick at me. I'm sorry to say I wasn't quite sure what he was doing at first, and so I didn't dodge it. It didn't matter. His three toed foot connected with my shoulder. I didn't move. It felt like a High School freshman had punched me in the arm. That wasn't what made me angry though. I was a dog to this creature, an unthinking animal that had no idea what was expected of it. It didn't matter that he was mistaken, the fact was that he believed it, which made the act the same as if any man had kicked his dog.

"Now you've pissed me off." I growled, glaring at Severus. "Your lucky I don't know how to grow these plants, or drive this ship, or take care of myself out here, or I might actually take you up on that fight. As it is, fuck off." I shoved his foot, which had fallen close to my side when I hadn't moved. My push sent it shooting out from under him as though I had tackled his leg. I hadn't meant to push that hard, but it worked out. He used his other three legs to catch himself, but the rage seemed to have been replaced by fear. Mama Giraffe and Dink were staring at me too, as were the gardeners. I didn't know what to do then, so I went back to my room, jumped onto the bed, and berated myself for making an enemy out of the blue-giraffe who was most likely the captain of the ship I was staying on.

After Cqcq'trtr left the Hydroponics bay, everyone present breathed a sigh of relief, Tnnxz most noticeable among them. 

"Well, I won't say that wasn't a surprise." Xkkrk finally clicked into the silence, "But you had it coming, Tnnxz. What were you about, kicking him? He didn't know why you were angry. He doesn't know that he shouldn't pick half the Cqcq plants in the hydroponics bay clean. He was hungry, so he went in search of food. He just seems to need a lot of it, though where he puts it is beyond me. We'll just have to find a way to get more food for him, since we're keeping him." At the last part, Tnnxz spluttered.

"Keeping it! Did you just see what it did!? It acted as though my kick was only a slight breeze, then threw my leg with almost a casual push! It's ruined half our Cqcq plants! I'd be surprised if any of them grew back. It's fulfilled all the qualifications of our last conversation about keeping it and more! Did you see the look it gave me? I've never felt such a predatory glare before in my life. And with its unprecedented strength, I'm more sure than ever that it was responsible for what happened to the Corti science vessel."

"Maybe he was," Xkkrk replied firmly, "But if he is responsible then he didn't do it without reason. You know how the Corti are. Their eugenics program removed every shred of empathy and compassion they had. They're little better than the monsters they study. As for how I know any of his actions were justified, you should look at yourself. I now have no doubts that if Cqcq'trtr had wanted to do to you what happened to those Corti scientists he could have. All he did was return the exact same thing you did to him, which is rather impressive restraint for an unthinking animal, if you ask me. He only started making those threatening noises when you began shouting at Vtv. I think he's just protective of the one that feeds him. Maybe you should look at him and follow his example, such as not shouting at your son when he did nothing wrong. None of us know anything about this creature, and surprises are bound to happen, or did you forget how quickly he filled the scented waste bin we placed in the medical bay for him to do his business in? Regardless, your behavior today has ensured that we're keeping him, since I have a feeling it may one day become useful to have an animal who is protective of our son and able to knock the legs out from under a Vzk'tk with a mere push, don't you?" 

With that, Xkkrk turned and swept out of the room, Vtv behind her, head down. She did not often give Tnnxz direct orders, but where her children were involved, there were no illusions as to who was in command.

Before she was completely out of the room, Xkkrk turned to Vtv with a stern look on her face. "One thing needs to change with Cqcq'trtr though, dear. You absolutely must get him a bath. I don't care if he won't let you put him in water. Throw it at him if you have to. He smells and looks absolutely revolting."
