# --- Welcome to BookOfReddit ---
# This edition of BookOfReddit will (BULK) write reddit posts to a file 
# only using UTF-8 formatting. If you don't know what that means, you 
# should use this file for general purposes.

# YOU NEED TO REPLACE CLIENT ID AND SECRET BELOW, OR ELSE IT WILL NOT WORK

reddit post compendium made by BookOfReddit (https://git.io/fA2dt)
options: bulk, UTF-8 ONLY
_________________________
This is a compendium of
Reddit posts compiled by
a program. Please go to
the end of the file for
more information such as
the number and url of the
posts inside.

The program used to make
this compendium is called
BookOfReddit and is
available at:

https://git.io/fA2dt

It is made and maintained
by @shaunakg on Github
and u/The_Removed on
Reddit.

I cannot guarantee great
formatting as Reddit is
weird. However the original
Markdown is preserved as
well as the links to the
posts.

Enjoy, and happy reading!

u/The_Removed,
Creator of BookOfReddit

NOTE: Due to the nature of
the program used to create
this, certain characters
such as the interrobang
(which is the '?' and '!'
characters mixed together)
have been replaced with
appropriate counterparts.
For example, the interro-
bang would have been
replaced with '?!'.
